# File Integrity Monitor
This PowerShell program will monitor files in a specific directory and will alert on any changes made to the files inside of the directory. Alerts include: adding files to the directory, changing contents of the files, and deleting/moving a file. 
`Note: The alerts will continue until a new baseline is created`
